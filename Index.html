					<p>My nephew Jeremy was born and raised in Omaha, NE along with his twin brother, Justin.  I spent a lot of time with both of them when they were younger; so much so that when one of Jeremy’s Kindergarten homework questions was “Who’s your best friend?”, his response was “Aunt Janet”.</p>

					<p>He has enjoyed sports throughout his entire life.  He played softball at a very early age.  He began playing league soccer when he was in grade school, and remained on the same team until he graduated from high school, and also played for Millard West all three years that he attended.</p>
					<p>His Dad started a tradition of taking him and Justin on a yearly fishing trip to Minnesota, and it continues to this day.  They cook the Walleye and Pike they catch when they come home, and share it at a dinner with the entire family.  He and his brother also enjoy snowboarding, and he went almost everyday when he spent a year living near Denver, CO.</p>

				<p>I’m very proud of my nephew.  It takes a lot of courage to start up a business, especially at such a young age.  That being said, I have no doubt that he will be successful in any career he chooses.</p>
